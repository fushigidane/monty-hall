        <p>
          Imagine Let's Make a Deal changed their rules and had 10,000 doors instead of three, with one door containing the car and 9,999 doors had a goat. The rules work like this: you pick a door, and Monty, knowing which door has the car, opens 9,998 different doors, leaving your first choice and one other door closed. Then he asks if you wish to switch.

          Say you pick door number one. Then Monty proceeds to open all the other doors, skipping door number 7,349. Is it in your favor to switch?

        Player's pick has a 1/3 chance on the car and 2/3 chance on a goat. As each one has 1/3 chance on the car, the combined chance of door 2 and door 3 hiding the car is 2/3.
        <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Monty_open_door_chances.svg/197px-Monty_open_door_chances.svg.png" /> <br />
        With the usual assumptions, after the host deliberately opened a door to intentionally show a goat, but without any further information, the player's pick still retains its 1/3 chance, likewise the other two doors still retain their combined 2/3 chance:
        Null for the door opened, but 2/3 for the host's second still unopened door.

      <div class='tutorial' id='carlton'>
        <h1>The Carlton Explaination</h1>
        An intuitive explanation is to reason that players whose strategy is to switch lose if and only if they initially pick the car; that happens with probability 1/3, so switching must win with probability 2/3 (Carlton 2005, concluding remarks). The fact that the host subsequently reveals a goat in one of the unchosen doors changes nothing about the initial 1/3 probability.</br></br>
        Simply put, if the contestant picks a goat (to which two of the three doors lead) the contestant will win the car by switching as the other goat can no longer be picked, while if the contestant picks the car (to which one door leads) the contestant will not win the car by switching. So, if contestants switch, they will win the car if they originally picked a goat and they will not win if they originally picked the car. As they have a 2 in 3 chance of originally picking a goat, they have a 2 in 3 chance of winning by switching.
