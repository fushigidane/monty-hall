        <p>
          Imagine Let's Make a Deal changed their rules and had 10,000 doors instead of three, with one door containing the car and 9,999 doors had a goat. The rules work like this: you pick a door, and Monty, knowing which door has the car, opens 9,998 different doors, leaving your first choice and one other door closed. Then he asks if you wish to switch.

          Say you pick door number one. Then Monty proceeds to open all the other doors, skipping door number 77,349. Is it in your favor to switch?

        Player's pick has a 1/3 chance on the car and 2/3 chance on a goat. As each one has 1/3 chance on the car, the combined chance of door 2 and door 3 hiding the car is 2/3.

        With the usual assumptions, after the host deliberately opened a door to intentionally show a goat, but without any further information, the player's pick still retains its 1/3 chance, likewise the other two doors still retain their combined 2/3 chance:
        Null for the door opened, but 2/3 for the host's second still unopened door.

      <div class='tutorial' id='carlton'>
        <h1>The Carlton Explaination</h1>
        An intuitive explanation is to reason that players whose strategy is to switch lose if and only if they initially pick the car; that happens with probability 1/3, so switching must win with probability 2/3 (Carlton 2005, concluding remarks). The fact that the host subsequently reveals a goat in one of the unchosen doors changes nothing about the initial 1/3 probability.</br></br>
        Simply put, if the contestant picks a goat (to which two of the three doors lead) the contestant will win the car by switching as the other goat can no longer be picked, while if the contestant picks the car (to which one door leads) the contestant will not win the car by switching. So, if contestants switch, they will win the car if they originally picked a goat and they will not win if they originally picked the car. As they have a 2 in 3 chance of originally picking a goat, they have a 2 in 3 chance of winning by switching.

        <h1>Welcome to the Strategic Dominance Explaination!</h1>
        Going back to Nalebuff (1987), the Monty Hall problem is also much studied in the literature on game theory and decision theory, and also some popular solutions (for instance, that were published in The Economist, see above, among the simple solutions) correspond to this point of view. Vos Savant asks for a decision, not a chance. And the chance aspects of how the car is hidden and how an unchosen door is opened are unknown. From this point of view, one has to remember that the player has two opportunities to make choices: first of all, which door to choose initially; and secondly, whether or not to switch. Since he does not know how the car is hidden nor how the host makes choices, he may be able to make use of his first choice opportunity, as it were to neutralize the actions of the team running the quiz show, including the host.
        Following Gill, 2011 a strategy of contestant involves two actions: the initial choice of a door and the decision to switch (or to stick) which may depend on both the door initially chosen and the door to which the host offers switching. For instance, one contestant's strategy is "choose door 1, then switch to door 2 when offered, and do not switch to door 3 when offered." Twelve such deterministic strategies of the contestant exist.
        Elementary comparison of contestant's strategies shows that for every strategy A there is another strategy B "pick a door then switch no matter what happens" which dominates it (Gnedin, 2011). No matter how the car is hidden and no matter which rule the host uses when he has a choice between two goats, if A wins the car then B also does. For example, strategy A "pick door 1 then always stick with it" is dominated by the strategy B "pick door 2 then always switch after the host reveals a door": A wins when door 1 conceals the car, while B wins when one of the doors 1 and 3 conceals the car. Similarly, strategy A "pick door 1 then switch to door 2 (if offered), but do not switch to door 3 (if offered)" is dominated by strategy B "pick door 3 then always switch".
        Dominance is a strong reason to seek for a solution among always-switching strategies, under fairly general assumptions on the environment in which the contestant is making decisions. In particular, if the car is hidden by means of some randomization device – like tossing symmetric or asymmetric three-sided die – the dominance implies that a strategy maximizing the probability of winning the car will be among three always-switching strategies, namely it will be the strategy which initially picks the least likely door then switches no matter which door to switch is offered by the host.
        Strategic dominance links the Monty Hall problem to the game theory. In the zero-sum game setting of Gill, 2011, discarding the nonswitching strategies reduces the game to the following simple variant: the host (or the TV-team) decides on the door to hide the car, and the contestant chooses two doors (i.e., the two doors remaining after the player's first, nominal, choice). The contestant wins (and her opponent loses) if the car is behind one of the two doors she chose.
